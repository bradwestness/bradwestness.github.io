<h2>About</h2>

<div class="page-content">
    <p>I'm a software developer living in south-central Wisconsin. This blog is my attempt to "own my name" on the internet.</p>
    <p>
        I blog about programming, web development, music, movies, philosophy and essentially anything else that
        happens to stick in my craw.
