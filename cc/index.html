<h1>What is Westness.cc?</h1>

<div class="page-content">
    <div class="d-xl-none d-lg-none d-md-none d-sm-block d-block d-print-none">
        <p>
            <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}">
                <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.logo }}" class="img-fluid rounded-circle" alt="Brad Westness" />
            </a>
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>   
        I registered the <a href="https://westness.cc">westness.cc</a> domain
        to serve as a "url shortener" type service for friends and family.
    </p>

    <p>
        If your last name is Westness and you'd like a subdomain (e.g. <a href="http://yourname.westness.cc">http://yourname.westness.cc</a>)
        or an email address (e.g. <a href="mailto:yourname@westness.cc">yourname@westness.cc</a>),
        just <a href="mailto:brad@westness.cc">shoot me an e-mail</a>, and I'll hook you up.
    </p>
