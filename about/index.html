    <p>     
        I am a software engineer living in south-central Wisconsin.
        I'm a progressive, a secular humanist, and a Brewers fan.   
    </p>

    <p>
        I blog about software development, Brewers baseball, music, movies, 
        philosophy and essentially anything else that happens to stick in my craw.
