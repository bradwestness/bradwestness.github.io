    <p>     
        I am a software developer living in south-central Wisconsin.
        I'm a progressive, a secular humanist, and a Brewers fan.   
    </p>

    <p>
        I blog about software development, Brewers baseball, music, movies, 
        philosophy and essentially anything else that happens to stick in my craw.

        If you have a web development project you'd like to work on,
        I started a company called <a href="https://sourdough.ltd">Sourdough LTD., LLC</a>
        through which I do software consultancy.
