title: Ayn Rand Was a Not a Republican

In the coming months, you're sure to be hearing a lot about the tea party's golden boy, Paul Ryan, who was just announced as the Republican candidate for vice-president.

He is on record as stating that Ayn Rand is the the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/14/opinion/weiss-ryan-rand/index.html" target="_blank">reason he got involved in public service</a>. Although he's more recently <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2012/aug/12/news/la-pn-vp-paul-ryan-ayn-rand-20120811" target="_blank">renounced his love of Rand</a>, he's still on record with the following quote:

> What’s unique about what’s happening today in government, in the world, in America, is that it’s as if we’re living in an Ayn Rand novel right now,” Ryan said. “I think Ayn Rand did the best job of anybody to build a moral case of capitalism, and that morality of capitalism is under assault."

> -Paul Ryan

I just thought it might be useful to share a couple more facts about Rand that Republicans and tea-partiers generally choose to ignore:

## <a href="http://dangerousminds.net/comments/ayn_rand_absolutely_hated_ronald_reagan" target="_blank">She Hated Ronald Reagan</a>

> What do I think of President Reagan? The best answer to give would be: But I don’t think of him—and the more I see, the less I think. I did not vote for him (or for anyone else) and events seem to justify me. The appalling disgrace of his administration is his connection with the so-called “Moral Majority” and sundry other TV religionists, who are struggling—apparently with his approval—to take us back to the Middle Ages, via the unconstitutional union of religion and politics.

## <a href="http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/abortion.html" target="_blank">She was Pro Choice</a>

> Abortion is a moral right—which should be left to the sole discretion of the woman involved; morally, nothing other than her wish in the matter is to be considered. Who can conceivably have the right to dictate to her what disposition she is to make of the functions of her own body?

Now, I'm not saying I agree with Rand. I think her politics were untenable and sophomoric and require tortured, circuitous logic to seem reasonable. They don't really hold up at all in the real world. But I think it's worth noting that even the people these far-right candidates hold up as their ideologues don't support them or agree with vast portions of their policies.
