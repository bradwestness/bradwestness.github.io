Less than a week after [my last post](https://www.bradwestness.com/2019/01/15/tuesdays-with-bernie-no-8-namesakes/), news came out that the [Brewers had sold naming rights
for Miller Park to American Familiy Insurance](https://www.mlb.com/brewers/news/brewers-announce-ballpark-naming-rights-deal/c-303013210), so the stadium will no longer be named Miller Park
as of 2021. That sort of negated part of my argument for the Brewers having the best namesake
in the league, since the corporate-named stadium will no longer be "on theme."

Being as it's headquartered out of Madison, American Family is on the not-so-horrible end of
the corporate naming sponsor in my opinion. Assuming, at least, that the ultimate name of
the stadium ends up being something innocuous like "American Family Ballpark" and not
something truly gross like "Discount Double-check Field" (yes, I know that the "discount 
double-check" thing is actually State Farm). Shade thrown, [Guaranteed Rate Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guaranteed_Rate_Field).
