Less than a week after [my last post](https://www.bradwestness.com/2019/01/15/tuesdays-with-bernie-no-8-namesakes/), news came out that the [Brewers had sold naming rights
for Miller Park to American Familiy Insurance](https://www.mlb.com/brewers/news/brewers-announce-ballpark-naming-rights-deal/c-303013210), so the stadium will no longer be named Miller Park
as of 2021. 

That sort of negated part of my argument for the Brewers having the best namesake
in the league, since the corporate-named stadium will no longer be "on theme."

Being as it's headquartered out of Madison, American Family is on the not-so-horrible end of
the corporate naming sponsor in my opinion. Assuming, at least, that the ultimate name of
the stadium ends up being something innocuous like "American Family Ballpark" and not
something truly gross like "Discount Double-check Field" (yes, I know that the "discount 
double-check" thing is actually State Farm). 

Shade thrown, [Guaranteed Rate Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guaranteed_Rate_Field).

Mostly, I think I'll probably never stop referring to the stadium as "Miller Park," because
that's what it has been called for 19 seasons, and old habits die hard, etc. Even Milwaukee
mayor Tom Barrett said he doesn't think the city will change the name of "Miller Park Way"
(the frontage road that connects the stadium to the interstate).

## In Praise of Small Markets

All this talk about naming rights has made me think about the old Milwaukee County Stadium,
and reminded me of one of my clearest memories of going to games there as a kid. The Brewers
were really not very good for most of my childhood, and games were sparesely attended. My 
folks would always get the cheapest tickets possible, so our ticketed seats were always in
basically the last row of the highest nosebleed section.

However, the beauty of the team being in a small market and the games being sparesly attended
was that the stadium staff absolutely did not police the seating at all. Me and my siblings would make a point of moving around the stadium and sitting in every section over
the course of the game. I specifically remember making it all the way around the whole loop
once, sitting in every section for at least an out or two.

We would always make a point of trying to get "the wave" going, exhorting the six to twelve other people in our section to join us as the four of us did a tiny wave over and over. It was
a huge accomplishment when someone would humor us and join in for a few rounds, although it
never really made it more than a section or two over since there were generally so few people
in attendance that you couldn't really track the wave's motion around the stadium.

People like to complain that baseball is boring because the action comes in fits and starts.
While I don't think this is actually true if you actually pay attention (strikeouts count
as action, too), I do think it's actually a feature and not a bug for even the casual observer.

As a six or seven year old attending a meaningless regular-season afternoon game between the 
Brewers and some other mathematically eliminated NL team, I wasn't exactly given to closely
watch every pitch. But I did have a blast moving around from section to section, glove in hand,
debating with my brothers about the best spot to maybe catch a foul ball.

Every so often, the bat would crack and the crowd would snap to attention to watch a long, loud
out, or stretch out your arm to catch a foul that wound up landing six sections away. You'd sing along to "Hit the Road Jack" whenever the Brewers chased the opposing starting pitcher.

If you were really lucky, you might even see Bernie take the plunge once or twice, releasing a bunch of blue and yellow balloons into the summer sky.
