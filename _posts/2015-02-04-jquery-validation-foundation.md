title: jQuery Unobtrusive Validation for Foundation CSS Framework
categories: [Software, .NET, Programming]
---

I had previously used the [jQuery Validation for Bootstrap](https://www.nuget.org/packages/jquery.validate.unobtrusive.bootstrap3/) integration 
in order to enable my [ASP.NET MVC](http://www.asp.net/mvc) web-apps to take advantage of [Bootstrap's input validation states](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#forms-control-validation), 
but I couldn't find anything similar for the [Foundation CSS Framework](http://foundation.zurb.com/) when using it for a recent project. 

So, I made one! It's just about 30 lines of JavaScript, but it will take your validation from looking like this:

To looking like this:

![After](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bradwestness/jQuery-Unobtrusive-Validation-for-Foundation/master/after.PNG)

It's available as a [NuGet Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/jQuery-Unobtrusive-Validation-Foundation/) and is [on Github under the MIT license](https://github.com/bradwestness/jQuery-Unobtrusive-Validation-for-Foundation), so go nuts!
