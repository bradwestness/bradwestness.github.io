title: The IKEA Standing Desk Adapter  
---
  
I've been reading about <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/05/ditch-your-office-chair-for-a-new-standing-desk/">standing desks</a> for a while now because <a href="http://www.medicalbillingandcoding.org/sitting-kills/">sitting is killing me</a>, and trying to figure out an inexpensive way to set one up for myself at work. I settled on making a "standing desk adapter" out of an <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/00095036/">IKEA <em>LACK</em> coffee table</a> which only set me back twenty bucks.

I measured the number of inches above my desk that my wrist rests at when standing with my elbow at a ninety degree angle, and then I cut the legs of the coffee table to the same length (taking into account the height of the table top). I then put some little <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;page=1&amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Afurniture%20pads">stick-on furniture pads</a> on each of the legs so that I wouldn't scratch up the surface of my desk at work.

Then, it was just a matter of trucking my "adapter" in and setting everything up.

Seems pretty good so far, but I definitely need one of those "anti-fatigue" mats for standing in one place for prolonged periods of time. Also my monitors seem just a touch wobbly (likely due to the somewhat flexible plastic stands they are on extending off the back of the adapter a bit).

All in all I think it's a pretty workable solution, and vastly cheaper than the pre-made standing desks you can get online or any <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ergo-Stand-Convert-Desk-Stand-Maple/dp/B007SN8PPO/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1358951689&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=standing+desk">pre-made adapter I've found</a>. If I ever feel the need to have my monitors slightly farther away, I might pick up the <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/40198396/">slightly larger square version of the LACK coffee table</a> to give the standing portion of my desk a little more real estate.

Eventually I may also convert it into a <a href="http://www.trekdesk.com/">walking desk</a>, but the desk-friendly treadmills are prohibitively expensive at the moment. I'm curious how difficult it would be to pick up a cheap standard treadmill and chop the handles off...
