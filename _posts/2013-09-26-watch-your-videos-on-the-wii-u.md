title: Watch Your Videos On the Wii U  
---
  
The Wii U doesn't have any means to connect to a shared folder to view your personal media files - and you can't watch videos stored on an SD card or a USB drive connected to the system.

I wanted to be able to watch the videos I have stored on my laptop, so I created a little web application that will display them so that they can be viewed via the Wii U's internet browser. I call it MediaBrowser.

Once you have it set up, you can open the Wii U's internet browser and view all the videos, images and audio files stored in folders you specify on your computer. No need to set up any fancy file sharing network or purchase any additional streaming media devices.

You can view the project homepage at <a href="http://bradwestness.github.io/MediaBrowser/">http://bradwestness.github.io/MediaBrowser/</a>, where there are instructions on how to download and configure the application. You can even contribute additional features via the GitHub repository. It's open source, baby!
