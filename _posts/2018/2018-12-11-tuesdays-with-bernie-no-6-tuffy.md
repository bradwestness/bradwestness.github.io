The "Winter Meetings" started this week, which means we should begin seeing some trade action. The most notable event so far has been the acquisition of a backup catcher to replace Jett Bandy, who was released by the Brewers back in May of 2018, shortly after they acquired Eric Kratz.

I was sad when the team lost Bandy, mostly because "Jett Bandy" is just such a great/ridiculous baseball name. It's one that could conceivably appear in the always-entertaining [Name of the Year](http://www.nameoftheyear.com/) bracket. However, over the weekend the Brewers made an acquisition of a new minor-league catcher that totally makes up for the loss: Tuffy Gosewisch.

## Loser Says What?

The best part about Tuffy Gosewisch's name, the thing that makes it truly great, are that both the first *and* last names are absurd. If his name was Tuffy Smith or something, that'd still be mildly funny. But "Gosewisch" is funny in and of it self, which is like a multiplier to the inherently funny Tuffy. 

Every time I hear this guy's name, I am going to do a double-take where, for a split second, I assume someone is trying to trick me with a ("Loser Says What")[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8dXG6jp-b4] type prank.
