title: The Gravity Well
---

Confession time. My whole adult life, I've had problems with binge drinking. For whatever reason,
I have the predisposition for it, and once I have one or two drinks, I can't stop until I've had
ten and blacked out and ultimately passed out. It's been this way pretty much since I turned 21.

At various points I've had pretty good success with staying sober. I feel like it's a weird phenomenon,
and a lot of people who don't experience this problem don't understand it very well. To me,
staying sober is easy as long as I just consider drinking to be completely off the table and not an option.

However, the problem is that as soon as I start fooling myself that I can handle it, and one or
two drinks on a special occasion won't hurt, it's like this long, slow descent into getting blackout drunk
multiple nights a week starts, a process that I am not in control of.

The best metaphor I can think of is those "gravity well" things you may have seen at the supermarket or library.
If you're not familiar with the term (I didn't know they were called "gravity wells" until I went to write this post),
they look like a giant funnel. You put a quarter in via a little chute thing, and then it rolls around the circumference
of the "well," getting faster and faster until it ultimately drops into a hole in the bottom.

Having that first drink is like putting your quarter down the little chute. Once you're in the well, you don't
really have control over what happens from there on out. For people who don't suffer from alcoholism, their
quarter stays up near the top of the well, rolling around, and it never really becomes a problem.

For people like me who do have alcohol problems, the gravity draws you inexorably downward over time,
spinning faster and faster and more out of control as it goes. You can still keep up the appearance of control
for a long time during this process, and your friends who are happily rolling along up near the top might see you
pass by during one particularly high oscillation and think everything is hunky dory -- but the trend line ultimately
only ever goes in one direction.

I had quit for over a year the last time my drinking really became a problem, and everything was good -- quitting cold
turkey is the only way to shut off the little voice in my brain that constantly wonders when the next opportunity for
getting drunk will be. 

You know who doesn't spend all day wondering when the next time they can get a drink will come? People who don't drink.

THe problem came on my wedding anniversary, when I convinced myself that it would be fine to have a glass of wine
or two -- it was a special occasion, after all! But the result was what you might expect; by putting my quarter back
down that chute, the process had begun until about a year and a half later when the bottom fell out again, after
several weeks of getting blackout drink three or four nights a week.

The mistake I'd made in the past was that I kept these issues private. My wife and one close friend were
the only people who ever knew about it in the past. That meant that when I decided I had the problem "under control"
and it was safe to drink again, there wasn't a lot of accountability. 

This time I am not making that mistake again. I've told everyone in my life who I might conceivably drink with that
it's not an option for me, and now I'm putting it out there via this blog post, too. I need to remember that
even though one, two, five, ten years might go by, I'm never suddenly going to be able to moderate with alcohol. It's just not in my D.N.A.

To that end, I got rid of the keychain that I've used basically since it became useful to me to carry a bottle opener:

I traded it in for this one, which holds a quarter. It's ostensibly so that you always have a quarter for use in
shopping carts at stores that require you to insert a quarter to unlock the cart, but to me it's a daily reminder not
to put my quarter down that gravity well chute.
