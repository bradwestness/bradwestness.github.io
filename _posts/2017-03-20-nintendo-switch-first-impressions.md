title: Nintendo Switch First Impressions, Part 1
---

For the past decade at least, I've been a "gamer" in so much as I always play the new
*Zelda* and *Mario* games when they are released, but that's pretty much it. So the
release of a new AAA game in either of those franchises is a pretty seismic event
as far as I'm concerned.

This January, Nintendo announced the release of a new, long-in-development *Zelda* title,
as well as the simultaneous release of a new console, the Nintendo Switch. The Zelda game
would be released for both the (then) current-generation console, the *Wii U*, and the Switch
on the same day.

Nintendo did this previously, with *Twilight Princess,* releasing it for both the GameCube and
the Wii simultaneously. I believe that in both cases, the game was intended to release on the
current console (the GameCube and Wii U, respectively), but development of the game took
so long that they ended up porting it over to the new console as well.

Last time this happened, I purchased the GameCube version, as I didn't yet own a Wii. I normally
wait until the price drops at least once before buying each new Nintendo console. The only
problem with that practice is that I inevitably end up re-buying the game on the newer system
eventually, as I did with *Twilight Princess* (I actually wound up buying it a third time, when 
the HD version was released for the Wii U).. 

So this time, I figured I'd go all-in. I sold my old Wii and Wii U, and all associated games and
accessories for each. I did this before Christmas in anticipation of the Switch, figuring I'd
get better prices selling them during the holiday gift-buying season versus afterward. For the
first time since I was approximately six years old, I owned no Nintendo systems or games. Dark times.

The Switch itself is a sort of hybrid console/portable system. It's not quite as portable as
a true handheld, like the various GameBoy and DS iterations over the years: the battery only
lasts for about three hours, it's too big to fit comfortably in a pocket, and the Joy Conâ„¢ do not
have the flattened buttons of a 3DS, and there's no clamshell to protect the buttons/screen,
like the Gameboy Advance SP (my personal vote for Greatest Handheld of All Time) and every handheld
Nintendo has released thereafter. You're going to need to bring a case if you're travelling with
this thing.

I don't think the fact that it's not a real "handheld" is necessarily a negative, however. I don't think
it's a mistake. I think what Nintendo has done is very intentionally nudged the system toward the center
of the spectrum between "home console" and "handheld," into a middle ground I'd call "portable console."

I believe this is a signal that Nintendo is giving up the ghost on the handheld market. They've begun
to release flagship games for the major smartphone platforms (*Pokemon Go* and *Super Mario Run* being
their first efforts in this direction). I'd guess that their strategy going forward is to continue
making games for iOS and Android and then just have this hybrid portable console but I don't expect
to see any more true handhelds from them.

The Switch is portable in the sense that you can slip it in your bag if you commute on the bus or 
the train, or bring it on a long car trip. Nintendo is not expecting this to come with you every time
you leave the house, like a GameBoy. Smartphones have already claimed that pocket space, a fact Nintendo
seems ready to finally accept.

What the Switch does do really well, is enable the scenario that Nintendo first floated with the Wii U's
GamePad, which is to free up the TV so that you can play games at home without hogging the entire living
room. This worked with the Wii U as well, but it was a sort of half-measure, since only certain games
supported playing solely on the GamePad, and you had to be within about ten feet of the console or else
the video signal would be lost, since the Wii U's GamePad was just a "dumb terminal," and all the actual
game processing was still done on the main unit even when playing on just the GamePad.

Even if you don't take the Switch with you when you leave the house, it's still freeing to be able to
take it anywhere you want *in* the house, while freeing up the TV so family members can watch what they want.
If you get a second dock, you can quickly move it between TVs if you have multiple, obviating the need to own
a second system (this is why I felt it was okay to sell both my Wii and Wii U, which were in different rooms).
Unlike the Wii U, this is also a system-level capability, so there's no need for games to support playing
in handheld mode on a case-by-case basis. It just works, for every game, all the time.
