Today is my last day of working at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater.

It is a strange, bittersweet thing.

After all, I've spent the entirety my adult life somehow connected to this institution. I was 21 when I first registered for class. I'm 28 now.

I had never lived away from home when I started attending. Now I own my own home. I had good times and bad times. I made and lost friends. I met my wife here. I had my first real job here.

I'm excited about my new position at UW-Madison. I love Madison, and it feels like getting called up to the majors from a triple-a farm team. I'm looking forward to joining a team of talented fellow developers and growing both personally and professionally.

But I have to say, I'll miss Whitewater -- I wouldn't be who I am today without the people and places it has been my pleasure to know over the past 8 years.

Good morning, Whitewater. And in case I don't see you -- good afternoon, good evening and goodnight.
