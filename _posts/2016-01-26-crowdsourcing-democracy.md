title: Fire Congress and Crowdsource Our Democracy

Dilbert creator Scott Adams has been writing an [interesting series of posts](http://blog.dilbert.com/tagged/Trump)
analyzing Donald Trump's usage of persuasion techniques during his presidential campaign.

In one of his [recent posts](http://blog.dilbert.com/post/138023808851/the-second-american-revolution-what-then),
he speculates that we could replace the office of the president with a triumvirate which
operates on a weekly live TV show that would increase transparency and force the officials
to "show their work" to justify how spending would work for proposed programs. He calls
this idea "firing the government," which he speculates would be popular due to
currently low approval ratings of our elected leaders in Washington D.C.

## Who Should We Fire? ##

While it's an interesting thought, I'm not holding my breath for it to happen any
time soon. To me, it is solving the wrong problem. Currently, Obama's approval rating
is [hovering around 46%](http://www.gallup.com/poll/188756/obama-averages-job-approval-year-seven.aspx)
(according to recent polls). Compare that to [George W. Bush's final approval ratings](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/bushs-final-approval-rating-22-percent/),
which were closer to 22%. Bill Clinton exited office around 58%. So I don't think the presidential
office is really the problem.

However, Congress' approval rating is [currently about 16%](http://www.gallup.com/poll/1600/Congress-Public.aspx). 
In 2008 it was approximately 20%, and during the Clinton presidency it hovered around 50%. It's
Congress that the American people are dissatisfied with, not the office of the president. We need
a figurehead to meet with other national leaders and represent us on the world stage. But do we
*need* Congress?

## Pure Democracy ##

We currently have a "representative democracy," which is a democracy in which representatives
are elected by constituent groups. Those representatives then vote on issues, hopefully in the
best interest of their constituents. This is done primarily because it is impractical to hold
a direct popular vote on every issue that requires deliberation. A government in which every
issue is voted on directly by popular vote is known as a "direct" or "pure democracy."

## Taxation Without Representation ##

It's not practical to hold a vote on every issue because, prior to the advent of the internet,
doing so is unfeasibly expensive and time consuming. That was true 240 years ago when our country
was founded, but is it still true today?

The problem with elected representatives is that they are individual human beings, who are 
succeptible to persuasion by monied special interest groups to vote against the best 
interests of the people who they were elected to represent. The current, historically low approval 
ratings of our congressional representatives (that includes both the House and the Senate) indicates
that an overwhelming majority of the public does not feel that their elected representatives
are actually acting in the best interests of the people who elected them.

## Direct Democracy via Crowdsourcing ##

What if, instead of Mr. Adams' proposed weekly televised presidential "office hours," we had a weekly
vote via the interent? There could be some kind of [UserVoice](https://www.uservoice.com/) style
voting system whereby the most pressing and popular issues would be brought to a vote each week.
Anyone who was a legally registered voter could then log in and vote via a web browser. People
who don't have access to the internet at home could vote in public libraries or other "polling places."

We could get rid of congress altogether. Think of how much taxpayer money is spent just on payroll
for our representatives in the house and senate. They all have six figure salaires, not to mention: aides, 
offices, health benefits, and retirement packages. Yet many of them don't show up for votes (especially
those who spend the majority of their terms campaigning for other offices), and when they do vote,
oftentimes they are swayed by wealthy campaign donors to vote against the desires of their electors. 
This leads to voters feeling disenfranchised and participating even less, which means our democracy has failed them. 

With a direct vote, that all goes away. We still need "checks and balances" of course, and the president 
would still have veto power over frivolous or impossible-to-implement bills, and the Supreme Court could still
review the constitutionality of any bills that pass. But I think technology has progressed
enough in the last century that we should seriously re-evaluate whether a direct democracy is actually
as impractical now as it was 240 years ago.
