Here are a few nifty quotes regarding Christianity from our God-fearing-slave-owning-only-white-males-may-vote founding fathers:

> The Government of the United States is in no sense founded on the Christian religion.
> 
> - John Adams (2nd president of the United States)

> The way to see by faith is to shut the eye of reason.
> 
> - Benjamin Franklin

> I have examined all the known superstitions of the world, and I do not find in our particular superstition of Christianity one redeeming feature. They are all alike founded on fables and mythology.
> 
> - Thomas Jefferson (author of the Declaration of Independence, 3rd president of the United States)

Since I'm a computer programmer, here's a bonus quote:

> Men never commit evil so fully and joyfully as when they do it for religious convictions.
> 
> - Blaise Pascal, Catholic Philosopher &amp; mathematician
