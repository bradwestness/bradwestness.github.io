Welcome to _Mondays with Bernie_, my new Brewers-themed baseball
blog series. My plan is to do one a week for the duration of the 2019 season, at least.

Starting a weekly blog series about the Brewers the last week of the season
in which they did not participate in the World Series might seem a little strange,
and it probably is, but it was such a great season, and set us up so well for
2019 to be a truly spectacular year, that I thought it would be fun to track
the entire thing a week at a time.

## Postseason Recap

First things first, let's talk about the Brewers postseason highlights from this year:

### Game 163

The Brewers went from 6 games back from the Cubs on August 28, to forcing a tie-breaker
game 163, which they won by utilizing five different pitchers, a common theme for the season.

### Sweeping the NLDS

All of Fox's pregame show hosts (Kevin Burkhardt, A-Rod, Frank Thomas, etc) picked the Rockies
to win the series, except for David "Big Papi" Ortiz. Ortiz' pick of the Brewers was immediately
followed by a prepared video package showing all of his incorrect picks in the past and the other
hosts made fun of him for making bad predictions. 

The Brewers then went on to sweep the best-of-five series, scoring 13 runs and allowing just 2 over
the course of 28 innings.

### NLCS and Game 7

The Brewers forced a game 7 in the NLCS against the Dodgers, by beating Clayton Kershaw and Hyun-Jin Ryu
in Milwaukee, and Walker Buehler in Los Angeles. To me, the crux of the series was the 13 inning marathon
in LA, in which the Brewers offense only came up with 1 run despite the defense keeping the Dodgers off the
board for 11 consecutive innings. 

Brewers needed to win that game, which would've put the them up 3-1 on the series with only one road game remaining.
As it stood, they came back to Milwaukee trailing 2-3, and needed to win out in order to take the series. They were
able to force a game seven due to an offensive bust-out in game six after being mostly silent the previous two
road games, but came up short in game 7. 

The common theme in my mind of the NLCS games the Brewers lost wasn't Jeffress' struggles or not having enough starters go 7 complete innings, it's that in the 3 of the 4 games they lost, they only scored 1 or 2 runs. You just can't realistically expect to win a championship series with a bunch of 1-0 games.

## The Road Ahead

The frustrating, traditionalist confirmation-bias story of this series is that the Brewers simply didn't have
the pitching staff to compete with the Dodgers because they relied on bullpen days and multi-pitcher innings
and stuff (including the unprecidented 1-batter "psych-out" appearance by Wade Miley in Game 4 of the NLCS). The truth
is that these things are essentially required in order for one of the smallest market teams in the league to compete at
a championship level, and made for fascinating chess-match baseball.

Let us not forget that the Brewers had the 22nd highest payroll in the league (out of 30), and yet managed to be among
the last 3 teams to face elimination. You can't do that by playing by the old rules. You need small-ball, you need
bullpen games, you need production from the 7-8-9 hitters to do that. You need a little bit of luck. That's what makes
rooting for a small market, underdog team fun and exciting. 

The Brewers are not going to snap up every big-name free agent who winds up on the block*. They're not going to stock
their starting rotation with all the high dollar guys who had a great season last year. David Stearns and Craig Counsell
understand this, and I believe they did a phenominal job of managing the team that the Brewers are, and not pretending
that they can win by doing the same things that the Red Sox or the Dodgers or Yankees would do in a given situation.

_* In hindsight, thank Uecker the Brewers didn't sign Machado, both from an offensive production perspective (or near-total lack thereof), as well as the fact that he's
obviously a preening jackass who is clubhouse poison._

I'm excited for next year. The Brewers have got a lot of their core guys coming back. Cain, Yelich, Aguilar, Jeffress, Braun, Hader, 
Woodruff, Burnes, and more will all be back for sure. News should start coming out over the next few weeks of who else
of the arbitration-eligible guys are getting resigned or not. 

It's an exciting time to be a Brewers fan!
