title: Yes, Dark Mode Reduces Eyestrain

Like so many other debates on the internet, we seem to be doomed to forever relitigate the question of whether "Dark Mode" color schemes are actually easier on the eyes than their "Light Mode" counterparts. Here's the most recent version of this argument that cropped up in my feed on Twitter:

{% include figure.html filename="light-mode_dark-mode_tweet.png" description="Yes, I use Twitter in 'Lights out' mode" %}

The thing that's weird about it to me is that the argument against having a dark theme is always made with this sort of accusatory, skeptical tone: is it ___really___ easier on the eyes? Do people ___really___ like it, or are they just being fashionable?

I have an astigmatism, which I'm sure affects my opinion on this - but I can say that yes, dark mode themes are ___definitely much easier on my eyes___ compared to light-mode themes. I get intense eye-strain pretty quickly when looking at anything with a plain white background on a computer screen for a long period of time. It ultimately turns into headaches that last for most of the day.

## It's the backlight, stupid

The reason for this is pretty simple: [PC screens are backlit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlight). There's a big LED light behind the screen that is shining towards your eyeballs. This is the difference-maker, and it's the reason dark themes on a PC screen are so much more important than on a printed book or a Kindle reader (the actual readers, not the Android tablets). You're staring directly into a light, and the brighter the screen is - the bigger the portion of the screen that's showing bright white - the more quickly your eyes become strained.

## Don't turn me into anything... unnatural

The other issue that I think compounds with the backlight of the screen, is that programmers and UI designers insist on using pure white backgrounds. I had a single web design class when I was in college, and the main lesson I recall the professor beating into us was to never use #FFFFFF (pure white) or #000000 (pure black) when developing websites. His reasoning was that these colors are not natural - they never appear in the real world.

You may think the pages of the book you're reading are white text on a black background, but if you take a picture of the book, and use the Photoshop eyedropper tool on it, you will find that they're pretty far from pure white or pure black. The "white" in the picture above is actually #D1C8C9, and the "black" is #443B3C. This is the sort of "black and white" your eyes are used to perceiving in the real world - nothing is ever truly white or truly black.

So, filling an entire screen with an #FFFFFF background is ___much___ harsher than anything you'd come in contact with in the real world. It's more like trying to read a piece of paper that's lit from behind by a light table than reading something by the ambient light of the sun.

## A land of contrasts

A lot of times, dark mode themes are also just more well-considered in terms of contrast than light mode themes. #000000 text on a #FFFFFF background is literally the highest degree of contrast a computer screen can display - so why is it the default for so many things?

I find that "dark themes" tend to use a more pleasing, less maximal amount of contrast than the light counterparts. Take the default themes in Visual Studio, for instance.

{% include figure.html filename="visual_studio_light.png" description="Visual Studio 2022 in the 'Light' theme" %}

The light theme is pure black (#000000) text on a pure white (#FFFFFF) background - the highest degree of contrast possible.

Meanwhile, the dark theme is off-white (#DCDCDC) text on a dark gray (#1E1E1E) background. This lower degree of contrast, coupled with not having the entire field of the screen be blindingly bright, means that this theme is much easier on the eyes.

If developers don't want to bother with adding themeability or at least a dark mode to their products, they should consider at least using a more reasonable amount of contrast in their main theme, and avoiding pure white and pure black.

Also, if, like me, you prefer dark mode themes, I highly recommend the [Dark Reader browser plugin](https://darkreader.org/). It's free, open source, and allows you to apply a nice, lower contrast dark (or light!) theme to any website that uses the dreaded pure black text on pure white background combination.
