In the last 12 months, I did the following:

1. Took my first "real" full-time job at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater
2. <a title="My Dogs" href="/about">Adopted two dogs</a>
3. Bought a house
4. Got married
5. Drove to Tennessee for two weeks for my honeymoon
6. Printed <a href="http://www.raggedbay.com">my band's</a> first "real" album <a href="http://www.raggedbay.com/merch/albums/lights-go-out-ep/">that you can buy</a>
7. Was the best man in my best friend's wedding

I think it's going to be a while before I beat 2011 on the eventfulness front. That's why, as you've heard so many sports coaches do before me, I'm declaring this a <strong>rebuilding year</strong>.

What I mean is that, while Mary and I want to start our family sooner rather than later (since we'd like to be less than a million years old when our kids graduate high school), we're barely scraping by as it is due to student loan payments and paying back money we spent on stuff for the wedding.

So, this year is a rebuilding year. We're going to keep our heads down and pay off as much as we can so that, at some point, we might be able to actually keep some of our money rather than have it all immediately spoken for in loan and credit card payments.

There's nothing wrong with a rebuilding year, everybody needs them once in a while. It will actually be nice to just spend time with Mary and the dogs and do projects around the house and "pay our dues."

Your fondest memories are usually of the times you were just goofing around at home with your loved ones.

We got some good prospects. Who knows, maybe next year we'll win the pennant!
