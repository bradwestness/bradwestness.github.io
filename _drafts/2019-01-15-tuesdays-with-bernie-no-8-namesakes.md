I'm sure it's partly due to having grown up in a region that happens to do it pretty unanimously,
but my favorite sort of sports team namesakes have always been the ones that are named
for whatever blue-collar industry the region is most known for. 

The Brewers are named for
[What Made Milwaukee Famous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7OSxQ3uKU0). The Packers are named
for [Indian Packing Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Packing_Company) (later absorbed by the ACME Packing Company). Even the Badgers are named for the [lead miners who first settled in Wisconsin in the 1820s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin_Badgers#Team_name_origin) (who "lived like badgers" in tunnels burrowed into hillsides). 

The one exception is the Milwaukee Bucks, but they were at least named for a game-hunting pastime that is popular in the area, and not my least-favorite type of team name, which is just some kind of predatory animal that may or may not have any actual connection to the team's location (Detroit Tigers, for example).

With this in mind, I'd now like to present the definitive ranking of all 30 MLB teams by namesake. All namesake origins were gleaned by reading the Wikipedia entry for each team.

# Definitive MLB Team Rankings by Namesake

## Group 1 - Regional Industry
My favorite grouping, these are teams whose namesake draws from some allustion to the industry the city is historically known for.

#### Milwaukee Brewers
Named for the city's association with the brewing industry

#### Kansas City Royals
Named after the "[American Royal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Royal)" livestock show, rodeo and barbeque competition

#### Houston Astros
Named for Houstan's involvement in the US space program

#### Seattle Mariners
Named for the prominent marine culture in the city of Seattle

#### Texas Rangers
Named for the law enforcement agency of the same name

## Group 2 - Ye Olde Base Ball
These teams have names which harken back to the 1800s origins of the game. They might not have much to do with the city the team is located in, but they're fun just because they serve as a reminder of the lengthy history of America's Favorite Pastime.

#### Pittsburgh Pirates
Originally the Pittsbugh Alleghenys due to their proximity to the Allegheny river, the team officially adopted the "Pirates" nickname in 1891 after the American Association acused the team of acting "piratical" by poaching a player from the Philadelphia Athletics (although the player they "stole" had been left off the Atheltics' official roster, and the Allegheny's were never officially found guilty of any wrongdoing by the league).

*Note: I was ready to put the Pirates much lower on this list due to
the seemingly generic nature of this name, but actually learned the origins in the process of researching for this post, which much more fun than it would be if they had just named themselves the Pirates because "pirates are cool," or whatever.*

#### Los Angeles Dodgers
Named after a nickname for 1930s pedestrians in Brooklyn who had to "dodge streetcars."

#### Oakland Athletics
Named for the amateur "[Athletic Club of Philadelphia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletic_of_Philadelphia)," where the team was originally located.

#### New York Mets
Named for a nickname of the New York Metropolitans, an American Association team from the 1880s.

#### New York Yankees
Originally the Highlanders, the team officially adopted the "Yankees" nickname in 1913.

#### Philadelphia Phillies
Named for a nickname the team made official in 1890, before which the team was the Philadelphia Quakers.

## Group 3 - Regional Generic
These teams have namesakes which refer to local geography or wildlife.

#### San Diego Padres
Named for the Spanish term for the Franciscan friars, who founded San Diego.

#### Minnesota Twins
Named after the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota.

#### Baltimore Orioles
Named for the official state bird of Maryland.

#### Tampa Bay Rays
Originally named "Devil Rays" after a species of manta ray, now simply refers to sunshine.

#### Miami Marlins
Named for a the species of fish which is indiginous to the region,

#### Toronto Blue Jays
Named for the bird which is indigenous to the region, although not the official bird of Ontario.

#### Washington Nationals
Named for the city being the nation's capitol, as well as the team being in the National League, after the Montreal Expos moved in 2005.

#### Colorodo Rockies
Named for the mountain range.

#### Los Angeles Angels
Named for the English version of the name of the city they play in.

## Group 4 - Regional Trying Too Hard
These are teams who have at least some connection to the place they play in, but whose names are the sort of thing a group of elementary school students would come up with to try to sound tough. As George Carlin would say: "Remember, these are my rules. I make 'em up."

#### Arizona Diamondbacks
Named for the Western diamondback, a rattlesnake native to the region.

## Group 5 - Totally Generic
These names really bear no connection to the team *or* to the place they play. These are the "I named my dog 'Fudge' because it's brown" of team namesakes.

#### Chicago White Sox
Named because they wore white socks. They were the White Stockings until 1904, when they officially adopted the "Sox" spelling often used in newspaper headlines at the time.

#### Chicago Cubs
Officially adopted a nickname given by the Chicago Daily News in 1907, before which they were confusingly *also* the Chicago White Stockings.

#### Boston Red Sox
Named because they wore red socks. Previously the Boston Americans, they used the same spelling as the White Sox when the team was renamed in 1907.

#### Cincinnati Reds
Named because they wore red socks. They were officially the Red Legs and the Red Stockings before changing to "Reds" in 1959.

#### St Louis Cardinals
Originally the Brown Stockings, renamed to the Cardinals, for the bird, in 1900. The state bird is the bluebird, however. Relegated to this group because, while cardinals are technically indigenous to the area, they are also indigenous to basically the entire continent, and South America too. Cast a less-wide net, y'all!

## Group 6 - Generic and Trying Too Hard
These are subtly distinct from the "totally generic" group in that they have no connection to the place the team plays, *plus* they're annoyingly childish. 

This category is much more common among NFL teams, who are much more
predisposed to stupid "badass" posturing than MLB teams in general.

#### San Francisco Giants
Named for the mythical creatures.

#### Detroit Tigers
Named after tigers. Which have no connection to the city of Detroit, as far as I can tell.

## Group 7 - Racist
Did I say the group of random predatory animals was my least favorite? That's because I blocked out even counting this group. 

While neither are as blatantly offensive as the Washington NFL team, they're still both incredibly lazy names whose iconography is problematic and we'd all be better off if they just changed the name.

#### Atlanta Braves
Named for a term for Native American warriors.

#### Cleveland Indians
Originally named the Napoleons (or "Naps") after player/manager Nap Lajoie, renamed to Indans after Lajoie departed the team in 1914.
