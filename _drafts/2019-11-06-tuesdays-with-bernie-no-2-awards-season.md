# Roster Moves

Despite being first week of the off-season, there's actually been quite a bit
of team news over the last week!

## Jeffress Re-signed

Jeremey Jeffress was phenominal over the entire regular season in 2018. He gave
up a few runs in the postseason, notably blowing a lead in game 2 of the NLCS in
Milwaukee by giving up a 2 home run to Josh Turner. However, I think he got an
unfair degree of criticism about this from the armchair managers of the world,
since the real problem with the games where he gave up runs was that the offense
only put 1 or 2 runs on the board. You can't expect to win games with that little
offense. 

He's had troubles with addiction, and seems to struggle everywhere else he's played,
while thriving in Milwaukee. He also seems like a great, even-keeled presence in the
clubhouse. I, for one, am really glad he'll be back.

## Moustakas, Soria are Free Agents

Mike Moustakas and Joakim Soria both declined to take a club option with the Brewers,
in favor of becoming free agents. They were both pretty good for the Brewers' postseason in 2018, although I think Moustakas didn't really produce offense at the
level that the team hoped he would, aside from the walk-off single in game 1 of the NLCS.

Personally, I think moving Travis Shaw over to 2nd worked out extremely well, after
the Brewers kind of flailed around all season trying to get some offensive production
from that position (while still maintaining a high level of defense). If I was the GM, I'd keep Shaw at 2nd, and move Thames over to third. 

After a strong start, Thames had a somewhat underwhelming season, due to Aguilar basically locking down what was intended to be a platoon at first base while Thames was injured by having a career-best season. I think Thames' offensive struggles
were probably largely due to not getting consistent at-bats, and I think he'd do
a lot better at the plate if he played every day. There are some guys who thrive
as pinch hitters even with irregular at-bats (Aguilar was actually very good at this), but I think Thames is just a guy who needs to be seeing MLB level pitching regularly in order to keep his eye sharp.

## I Believe That Vogt Will Catch

In sad news, I'm disappointed that the Brewers elected to outright Stephen Vogt from
the roster, and he has also become a free agent. I will admit that with Vogt, I mostly am just sad because he's got an [excellent crowd-participation chant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azTGrocYlu4), which followed him to Milwaukee from Oakland.

He also seems like a good clubhouse presence and played Hamilton Porter in [the Brewers' *Sandlot* tribute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SQjoGO773Y). With Eric Kratz also unlikely to return for the 2019 season, the Brewers have a need at the catcher position. They could theoretically re-sign Vogt from free agency, but it'll definitely be something to watch over the offseason.
